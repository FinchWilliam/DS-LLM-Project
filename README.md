# LLM Project

## Project Task
To build a Large Language Model based that will detect a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.
 - refer to [Project Journal](LLM-git/DS-LLM-Project/Project Journal.ipynb) for a breakdown on thought process and how we went about each task

## Dataset
We are using the [Yelp Reviews Full dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yelp/yelp_review_full) from Hugging Face, this rates our reviews on a 1-5 star rating (0-4) we will take that as (0, 1) being negative, 2 being neutral, and (3, 4) being positive 

## Pre-trained Model
I trialed a few pre-trained models with some very poor inital looks, and settled on [this one](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) from cardiffnlp that was traned on twitter as it had a large amount of downloads
